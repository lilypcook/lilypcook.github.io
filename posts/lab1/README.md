# Lab 1:  Reviewing Quarto, `ggplot` and `dplyr` & Getting to know your classmates

For the last two questions of this lab, you will need to use the Discord server
or talk to your peers in class!

Once you've completed the lab, render your document and push it to GitHub.

On Canvas, you will submit your rendered HTML file and the link to your GitHub
repository*. 

* You should have more than one commit! :)
