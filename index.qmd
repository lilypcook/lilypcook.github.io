Hi, I'm Lily. I am a graduate student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo currently wrapping up my MS in Statistics, on track to graduate June 2025. I am excited to enter the work force as a data analyst. My time at Cal Poly has equipped me with a robust understanding of statistical methodologies, data modeling, and the power of extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. I'm eager to apply these skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions and solve real-world problems. I'm a curious and analytical thinker with a passion for uncovering patterns and communicating findings clearly and effectively. I'm excited to connect and explore opportunities in the data analysis field!
